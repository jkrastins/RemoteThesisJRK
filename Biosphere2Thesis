# Introduction

## Soil Microbial Ecology: A Primer

Soil Microbial Ecology is, broadly defined, the study of living things fully or partially invisible to the naked eye such as Bacteria, Archaea, and some Eukaryotes, in the context of how they interact with other living organisms present in an edaphic (soil) environment. This typically also includes fungi, mites, and nematodes, since although many of them are at least partially macroscopic, most ecologically relevant interactions take place on a microscopic level [@pavao2008soil]. These interactions take a variety of forms, depending on the organism, and include decomposition, predation, and chemosynthesis. As such, these interactions are an important area of study for ecology as a whole. In particular, the microscopic edaphic ecology is of fundamental importance to two major ecosystem processes that affect the aboveground: the recycling of decaying organisms into soil nutrients, and the acquisition of those nutrients by plants [@amber2008soil]. The majority of soil microorganisms present in a given ecosystem are typically involved in one of these two processes, either primarily or secondarily (e.g. as parasites of plants or predators of soil microbes) [@pavao2008soil]. Extending out further, the soil microbial community has profound impacts on every organism present in an ecosystem, as soil-rooted plants form the energetic basis of the majority of the planet's terrestrial ecosystems. Some examples of important symbiotic interactions include the nitrogen fixation of certain plant groups with symbiotic bacteria, arbuscular endomycorrhizal fungi associated with the roots most plant groups, and ectomycorrhizal fungi associated with the roots of trees.

## Importance of Fungi

Among the soil microorganisms, fungi form a major component that contributes to nearly every type of ecological soil interaction. They form symbionts with plants, break down both organic and inorganic matter in the soil, and can act as parasites for plants, animals, and other fungi [@gadd2007geomycology; @peterson2004mycorrhizas; @ainsworth2013fungal]. 

Among their symbioses, one ecologically important category are mycorrhizae. These symbioses are formed by fungi which closely associate themselves with the roots of plants, and exchange inorganic nutrients with plants in exchange for sugars and other plant-derived organic compounds [@peterson2004mycorrhizas]. the two primary categories are endomycorrhizae, which live closely associated with plant tissues within plant roots, and ectomycorrhizae, which live on the outside surface of the roots of woody trees. Endomycorrhizae are highly specialized fungi found within the Division Glomeromycota, which consists mainly of thse symbionts. Ectomycorrhizae and found mostly within the Basidiomycota, with some from other orders as well. There are also other, more specialized forms of mycorrhizal associations formed within certain plant orders, such as ericaceous and orchidaceous mycorrhizae. Plants within the order Ericaceae are typically specialized to inhabit acidic, nutrient-poor soils, and form special ectomycorrhizal associations with specific fungal species that allow them to obtain nutrients from their ecosystems [@cairney2003ericoid]. Plants in the Orchidaceae are not able to obtain their own nutrients independently as newly germinated seeds, and depend on mycosymbionts to obtain the necessary nutrients for early growth before to production of roots and leaves [@sathiyadash2012mycorrhizal]. 

Saprobic fungi tend to be the most common fungal species found in soils, and make up a large percentage of forest soil fungal biomass [@lanforest; @schappe2020co; @schimann2020tree]. They can be either generalists that decay a wide variety of organic matter, such as many species of molds in the Ascomycota and other divisions, or more specialized for wood decay, which is primarily found among the Basidiomycota [@ainsworth2013fungal]. They are essential to the recycling of nutrients in the soil, as their decay processes liberate nutrients bound up in the physical bodies of plants, animals, and fungi and make them bioavailable to other soil organisms. Their ability to decay wood is of particular importance, as Basidiomycete fungi are among the small number organisms cabable of digesting lignin, the primary compound in wood [@bugg2011pathways]. 

Fungi are also important parasites of organisms, particularly of plants, for which they are a leading cause of disease burden and mortality [@dean2012top]. Fungal pathogens make up roughly 85% of all known plant pathogens, and affect plants at every part of the plant and in every stage of development.
The largest organism on earth is a root parasite of conifer trees, *Armillaria mellea*, found across several acres of land in the Blue Mountains of Oregon [@smith1992fungus].

With their importance to all of these factors of soil health and diversity within ecosystems, any comprehensive survey of soil microbial flora should perform a thorough examination of the present diversity of fungi. In order to accurately survey the variety of organisms present, it is necessary to use PCR amplification to isolate fungal DNA in the form of Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs), which are DNA fragments of sufficient length to accurately allow for the taxonomic placement of the microorganism they originated from. obtaining OTUs from a sample though the use of PCR isa n important tool in the study of metagenomics, which is the study of the greater microbial community of an area through the use of molecular methods.In order to obtain good OTUs froma sample, it is important to develop accurate primers which can bind to the DNA in the soil.

In the study detailed in this thesis, I analysed a dataset gathered in a study on nitrogen pulse dynamics in the dry season of the artifical rainforest of Biosphere 2. The dataset contained OTUs amplified from soil using 2 different fungal primers: a standard primer developed by academia, and a second primer set developed by the Joint Genome Institute (JGI), part of the U.S. Dept. of Energy. Through my analyses, I have revealed the diversity of fungi present in these data, as well as attempted to determine which of the two primer sets used are more effective at revealing the fungal diversity present in soil samples.

## Methods of Study

Although the importance of soil microorganisms, such as fungi, have been widely recognized as fundamental to ecosystems for years, the ability to study them in-depth has had to wait on the development of modern microsopic and molecular techniques in order to be able to elucidate much of the diversity and interactions present in the soil [@pavao2008soil]. 
Starting in the 19th century, compound microscopes enabled scientists to view some microorganisms with the naked eye [@weisenburger2015light]; however, while microscopy is useful for studying things such as morphology, it gives limited information as to the ecological roles, interactions, and diversity present in a given sample of soil. The creation of standardized microbiological protocols and media around the turn of the century further allowed for the isolation of microbial strains from samples, allowing researchers to discover and maintain pure strains of single species. However, these conventional techniques were developed in a clinical setting for organisms cabable of growing in the human body, and do not work as well with environmental samples that grow in conditions which are highly different from the human body; Relative to the human body, the soil environment generally has much colder and less stable temperatures, less abundant food sources, and no immune system to evade. Thus, environmental microorganisms grow best on highly specialized media, if at all, unless they are also capable of growing in the human body. This is estimated to be less than 2% of bacteria species [@wade2002unculturable]. With fungal species, it varies significantly with their primary food source. Fungi which grow as generalist saprobes often grow on enriched media engineered with fungi in mind, and parasites can sometimes be grow on media if the nutrients they require are present. However, all of the more specialized soil species, particularly those closely associated with wood decay and tree symbioses, are not feasible to cultivate in the laboratory. As these make up a significant proportion of forest soil microbiota, non-cultivation techniques are required to detect their presence.

## PCR

Of the non-cultivation based techniques used in microbiology, one of the most important is Polymerase Chain Reaction, or PCR. This molecular biological technique was developed after the discovery of DNA and the subsequent discovery of specialized high-temperature DNA polymerases [@morange2000history], and allows for the easy collection of environmental DNA from soil.  

Even with PCR capabilities, soil can present challenges to isolating good DNA samples. Soil is typically mixed with contaminants such as clay and humic acids, and fulvic acids that attract and adhere DNA molecules to their surface [@hirsch2010culture]. Contaminants such as these must be removed before processing can proceed. Thankfully, procedures developed in the late 90s allow for the removal of these contaminants from a DNA sample prior to processing [@cullen1998simple].

## Primers

Primers are nucleotides that bind to and recognize specific types of DNA, and act as guides for polymerase binding. Through the use of PCR, it is now possible to create detailed profiles of organisms present in a given soil ecosystem. However, PCR can only be performed on an organisms DNA if sufficiently specific primers are present to bind to the DNA.

As mentioned previously, primers are essential to the initiation and proceeding of DNA synthesis. They are short, single-stranded nucleic acids made from RNA, which recognize a specific region of DNA, guiding DNA polymerase to replicate that region [@wilcox2013robust]. In living organisms, the specific nature of primers allow for the regulation of protein synthesis through changing which primers are created for which gene set based on environmental conditions. This ensures that proteins which are not needed at the time are not manufactured, which would waste valuable cellular resources. In molecular biology, their capacity to recognize specific regions of DNA is exploited to amplify only DNA that is unique to a particular group of organisms, allowing only DNA from that group to be isolated from a sample.

Accurate primers are essential to allow for PCR recognition of organisms from an environment, and developing primers can be challenging [@wilcox2013robust]. This is because detailed knowledge of the DNA of an organism relative to other groups is needed to allow for the creation of primers that can bind to a region of DNA unique to the target group. Even with this knowledge in hand, it is important for a researcher to identify regions of the DNA that are not subject to significant evolutionary forces. An example of this is the 16S rRNA region present in bacteria; since it is involved heavily with the basic machinery required for bacterial replication and growth, it is not subject to strong evolutionary selective pressures [@klindworth2013evaluation]. Most major groups of organisms have had specific suites of primers developed for studying them.

## Fungal Primers

Creating primers to isolate fungal species present in soil presents unique challenges compared to other groups. For the many groups, the ribosomal RNA coding region is often to most reliable targeting region, and is commonly used for bacteria and animals. In fact, the rRNA coding region, CO1, is very similar for fungi and animals in overall nucleotide composition [@xu2016fungal]. The challenge is that although they are very similar, the fungal rRNA barcoding region often contains other protein-coding introns that are subject to higher selective evolutionary pressure, and thus produce less-than-optimal results when identifying fungal DNA samples. Another challenge is that fungal DNA tends to be extracted directly from the soil, and carries not only the aforementioned soil challenges, but also tends to be mixed with the DNA of what the fungus is currently consuming, which is typically plant tissue in soil samples [@hirsch2010culture; @martin2005fungal]. Thus, the primers need to also not show any compatibility with plant primer sequences to successfully amplify target sequences.

Due to these factors, the search for universal, specific fungal primers would have to work to target other highly conserved genetic regions in the fungal genome. Research began into creating effective fungal-specific targeting primers in the 90s, with the creation of several different primer groups, including not only the early ITS-targeting "ITS1" and "ITS4" primers, but also 18S ribsomal subunit primers, and RPB1 and 2 genes involved in Vitamin A transport [@white1990amplification; @schoch2012nuclear]. In the ensuing 15 years, the ITS primer system began to gain more traction within the mycological community, with several different groups developing competing primer sets based on the move developed ITS1/ITS2 targeting model, beginning with the work of Martin et al. in 2005 [@martin2005fungal]. These improved over the older "ITS1/ITS4" models developed in the 90s, as further improvements in the understanding of the exact size and nucleotide sequence of the ITSs regions became known [@martin2005fungal]. ITS-region primers have gone on to become the primary fungal DNA primer for most applications, with higher demonstrated targeting effectiveness than competing primers [@schoch2012nuclear].

![The ITS Region of the Fungal Genome](Figures/ITSRegion.png)
CC by [@kim2013isolation]

The ITS region of fungal DNA were chosen as the ideal target region due to their proximity to the ribosomal rRNA coding region, and are thus not translated or otherwise used for coding proteins [@martin2005fungal; @xu2016fungal]. Another advantage is that the ITS regions tend to contain numerous tandem repeats, meaning that there is generally a large amount of DNA from this region present in any given sample [@xu2016fungal]. Thus, they make an ideal target for primer development and species identification. 

As the ITS primer amplification region has become the primary fungal molecular identification method, competing groups have attempted to build on and improve on the new ITS1/ITS2 primer system, particularly after the influential Schoch et al. 2012 paper, in which an array of collaborators compared the effectiveness of rRNA, ITS, and RPB1 and 2 (Vitamin A transport genes) in revealing fungal diversity in samples, and showed that the ITS system had the strongest results [@schoch2012nuclear]. Since then, the ITS1 and ITS2 systems have continued to be refined. Recently, the ITS2 system has been found to be slightly more sensitive than the ITS1 in some studies [@tedersoo2014global; @tedersoo2015shotgun]. 

Due to the importance of further refining the effectiveness and sensitivty of the ITS2 primer, there have been efforts to develop and improve upon its effectiveness, as the ITS2 primer still does not pick up on some less-abundant but still important fungal phyla [@tedersoo2016fungal]. The U.S. Dept. of Energy Joint Genome Institute generated a new iteration of the ITS2 primer, which is competing with a second popular standard ITS2 primer that was developed by Ihmark et al. [@ihrmark2012new]. As standardization and reproducibility across datasets is of high importance for scientific research and inquiry, it is important that studies are done to determine which types of fungal primers are most effective for elucidating the fungal diversity present in a sample. Through examining the results of two different ITS2 primer amplified datasets using in silico bioinformatics techniques, one using JGI primers and another with the Ihrmark version of the Allen 1990 standard primers, this study aims to provide evidence of which ITS2-targeting primer set may be more effective at revealing soil fungal diversity present in a sample. The soil samples used to accomplish this have been taken from Biosphere 2 outside Tucson, AZ.

## Biosphere 2

Biosphere 2 is what is called a mesocosm; that is, an environment which simulates a variety of natural climates in an enclosed environment [@marino1999biosphere]. In addition to simulating rainforest climates, it simulates coral reef, desert, and grassland climates as well.
Biosphere 2 was conceived by businessman Ed Bass and systems ecologist John P. Allen in 1984 as an attempt to create a prototype of the "spaceship earth", a fully enclosed, self-sustaining ecosystem capable of supporting and sustaining human life, as well as the lives of other organisms. These reserves could act as insurance against calamity, or aid in long-distance space travel and exploration [@allen1990historical]. It was named Biosphere 2 to play off the idea that the earth itself was "Biosphere 1". As the human aspect was the main focus, the initial attention of the research was directed towards sustaning humans in the environment, with two experiments conducted in the 90s involving people living in the Biosphere 2 seperate from the outside world for 2 years and 6 months, respectively. Overall, the experiments were not considered successful, and outside intervention was required in both cases to enable human survival due to mismanagement both before and during the missions [@allen1999overview; @severinghaus1994oxygen; @weyer2000energy]. Besides the human aspect, there were failures ecologically: many of the species added to the Biosphere 2 did not survive well, and the ecosystems became dominated by only a few hardy pioneer species [@wetterer1999ecological; @leigh1999tropical]. 

Despite these failings, however, Biosphere 2 still has strong potential scientific merit. Namely, Biosphere 2 represents a good environment for studying in-depth chemical cycling processes because it provides both easier and more controlled access to a variety of ecosystems, making it a popular place for studying in-depth envrionmental cycling processes [@atkinson2001nutrient; @severinghaus1995studies; @nelson1999bioregenerative; @van2005drought]. This is because a wide variety of sensor equipment is present in the facility, making data collection easy [@marino1999biosphere]. However, using Biosphere 2 to perform such studies is not without issues. In particular, it displays a limited variety of organisms present in each environment, and the ecosystems present have been likened to ecosystems under high pressure from humans. This is likely due to the highly enclosed nature of the ecosystem, combined with a lack of adequate ecological understanding when creating the facility. A particular dearth of knowledge is present when it comes to the soil ecology of the facility. The soil microorganisms were not deliberately introduced or designed, and come primarily from three sources: microbes brought along as symbionts or phoresy on plants and animals, microbes brought in with the soil, water and other amendments added during construction, and microbes that were already present within the soil during creation. Of the three groups, the final group might be the least abundant within the rainforest environment, due to the very different soil characteristics between a rainforest ecosystem and the base ecosystem of the Sonoran desert.

During the late 90s and early 2000s, the Biosphere 2 fell into disrepair. In 2007, it was acquired by the University of Arizona, who began a long redesign and rehabilitation process of the the Biosphere as a dedicated biological research facility. In order to rehabilitate and use the facility for serious long-term ecological study, it is important to understand the current extent of the biological diversity present, both on a micro and macro scale, so that future work can be done in order to introduce new species to make up ecological imbalances, as well as endeavoring to remove or mitigate the prescence of intefering species. In particular, understanding the soil ecology of the rainforest is important. This is because the soil is intimately linked with the rest of the biogeochemical cycles of the facility. If the facility is to act as a good simulation of natural environments, understanding what is present is the first step to creating a more complete and accurate representation of a rainforest ecosystem.


## Soil Microbial Profiles: Study Data Source

The primary source of data for this study came from an Honor's thesis project done by Juliana Young at the University of Arizona, with the assistance of primary faculty collaborator Dr. Jana U'Ren, among others [@young2017microbial], who collected and provided much of the data. The primary goal of the study was to examine nitrous oxide flux cycles in the soils of the enclosed tropical rainforest found in the Biosphere 2 reserve located outside of Tuscon, Arizona. She was testing to see how periodic drought affected the production of nitrous oxide, a byproduct of soil microbial metabolism, at various locations throughout the rainforest. In doing this, she sequenced a large amount of genomic data from both the bacterial and fungal communities present in these sites. however, she was only able to evaluate the data for the bacterial communities, leaving an open question as to the extent of the fungal diversity present in these rainforest samples. Understanding the diversity present in the Biosphere 2 reserve is important for understanding how well the ecosystem can act as a facsimile for naturalistic ecosystems, as well as helping the maintainers of the Biosphere 2 plan ways to engineer the reserve to be a better experimental environment for simulating a tropical forest ecosystem.

## Overview of Study

This study aims to take the un-analyzed dataset of fungal genomic sequences gathered by Young et al. and analyze them in the context of fungal diversity, using several genomic data statistical processing and display software suites, using primarily the R scripting language in the RStudio integrated open-source coding and development software program. Using the phyloseq and VEGAN genomic RStudio-based statistical analysis software packages, along with the FUNGuild fungal functional guild assignment software in the Python scripting language, this study aims to process the raw genomic data gathered by Young et. al. These analyses, statistics, and graphics will elucidate two primary questions: firstly, what is the overall levels of fungal soil microbial diversity in the rainforest soil of Biosphere 2, and secondly, which set of primers is better at revealing the diversity of soil organisms present in these samples?

# Methods

## Original Data Collection

The original data collection was done under an Honors project done by Juliana Young at the University of Arizona with assistance from several other collaborators, including Dr. Jana U'ren, her faculty advisor [@young2017microbial]. The original study was examining nitrous oxide pulse dyanmics under drought conditions in the simulated rainforest environment of Biosphere 2. Collection was done at 5 different sites located throughout the rainforest, at several soil depths: Northwest (NE) at 1 (0-100cm), 2 (100-200 cm), and 3 (200-300 cm) depths, South (S) at 1, 2, and 3 depths, and Northwest (NW) at depths 1 and 2. in order to estimate drought effects, samples were taken before adding water, after 3 hours, 6 hours, 9 hours, and 11 hours. Additionally, a high-pulse (HP) nitrogen site was identified near the NE site, and a low-pulse (LP) nitrogen site was sampled near the S site. Both were harvested at the 1st depth only. Sequencing on the samples were done with 16S rRNA primers (for bacteria) and ITS2 Primers (for fungi). The two primer sets for the ITS analysis were ones created by the Joint Genome Institute of the U.S. Department of Energy, with the second set being developed by Ihrmark et al 2012 [@ihrmark2012new].

## Preprocessing of FASTA files

In order to preprocess the FASTA files for efficient display of data further down the pipeline, I downloaded the two primer datasets and combined them into one source file, removing any data sample locations appearing in only one primer dataset to ensure comparability. I then renamed the files appropriately using names from provided metadata CSVs to ensure ease of software compatibility and visualisation. The files I sequencened using the standard primer dataset had the prefix LM. added for Laura Meredith, the collaborator who sequenced them, while I named the ones sequenced using the JGI primers using the -JGI suffix. Other than that, files were named by the time in hours they were sampled after watering (Pre, 3, 6, 9 and 11), the sample location (NE, S, NW, LP, and HP), and the sample soil depth (1, 2 or 3)

## DADA2

DADA2 is an open-source software suite developed by Callahan et al. for modelling and correcting errors in Illumina-sequenced genomic datasets [@callahan2016dada2]. Before processing with DADA2 software functions, I set the file location; then, I used the filter_path function in order to filter out bad reads.
                              
For that function, I chose the following parameters: The first 25 bases of each read were removed (to remove the primer), remove all reads with ambiguous nucleotides (Ns), allow no more than 4 errors, and truncate sequences at a size (240 bp) which quality analysis suggested was the longest size before significant drops in read quality occured. This allowed me to remove both the primer sequence, and also the worst of the reads featuring many errors. I next fed the filtered results into the learnErrors function, which estimated the number of errors present in the samples. I followed this with the derepFastq function, which removed duplicate sequences found in the ITS data as directed by the learnErrors function. Next, I piped the data though the dada function. This program  is the core random sample interference algorithm of DADA2, which randomly sampled the data from each distinct data point to reduce the overall size of the data pool. I did this to make the data a much more manageable size, while keeping the data as comprehensive and representative as possible.

In order to move forward in the pipeline, I compiled the data into a sequence table to make an efficent form for further processing. After this, I removed chimeric sequences from the data using the removeBimeraDenovo function. Bimeras form when different DNA sequences get joined together, and can give a false positive as an OTU. Finally, I assigned taxonomoy using the taxa function, using the latest release of the UNITE fungal database as a reference, in order to identify the OTUs. I then handed off the filtered, dereplicated, inferred, dechimeraed, and taxonomy-assigned data to the phyloseq function.


## Phyloseq

Phyloseq is an R package designed for reproducible, interactive analysis and visualization of microbiome data [@mcmurdie2013phyloseq]. Due to this, It was one of the main visualization software packages I used, along with the VEGAN package. In order to visualize the data, I used a special data format called a phyloseq object. Phyloseq objects combine various data and metadata into one file, that can be used to create visualisations. I created it using the phyloseq package by utilizing the sequence table and taxa table from DADA2, along with a manually created .csv file. Following this, the phyloseq package was used to create several plots of the overall species richness across the different sample sites and depths using the plot_richness phyloseq function using the "observed", "Fisher", and "Shannon" alpha diversity assessment indicies. The latter 2 indicies are standards used to measure richness and eveness of species in order to evaluate the diversity of fungi present in the sample sets.                    


## VEGAN

VEGAN is a software package designed to add useful statisical functions for ecologists to the basic R package for use in RStudio [@dixon2003vegan]. I used the functions in this toolset to generate statistical and graphical outputs. 

Before using the various functions, I extracted OTUs from the phyloseq object and prepared them for applications using the otu_table phyloseq function. Next, I then used the VEGAN rarefication toolset to randomly sample and rarefy the resulting data. The random sampling before rarefaction was important to do because there was a large size discrepancy bewteen the sampling sizes in the standard and JGI primer datasets, with the JGI set being much larger. Without some form of random sampling and size standardization between the two datasets, there could be skewed results that make comparison harder. I next created summary stat tables of the OTUs for the observed, Fisher, and Shannon alpha diversity measures.

The next test I did on the data involved using the rarecurve function to create a rarefaction curve; this curve allowed for a more accurate comparison between the standard and JGI datasets by controlling for the significantly larger sample size present in JGI sample size, while presenting it in a graphical display format.
 
The final set of analyses I did using the VEGAN stats package involved estiamting the beta diversity of the samples using the beta dispersion function. This serves as a measure of how similar different fungal communities from different sites were. This was created via processing the rarefied data using a Bray-Curtiss dissimilarity index.
 
Finally, I used the permutest function in order to ensure the homogeneity of the multivariate dispersions. I used sample source to group the data so that the differences between the JGI and standard datasets could be accurately visualized by the plot function.

## FUNGuild

FUNGuild is an open-source Python script developed by Nguyen et al. at the University of Minnesota, St. Paul that is designed to parse fungal OTU datasets and assign functional groups to the OTUs based on a taxonomy [@nguyen2016funguild]. In order to use the script, I formatted the taxonomy CSV file into a compatible form by use of the paste function, and then merged it with the original sequence table CSV using the merge function.

# Results

## Species Richness Results 

![Alpha Diversity: Observed](Figures/CombinedDataFigures/CombinedAlphaRRare.png)

(Fig. 1: Observed Alpha Diversity)

![Alpha Diversity: Fisher](Figures/CombinedDataFigures/CombinedAlphaFisher.png)

(Fig. 2: Alpha Diversity, Fisher Scale)

![Alpha Diversity: Shannon](Figures/CombinedDataFigures/CombinedAlphaShannon.png)
 
 (Fig. 3: Alpha Diversity, Shannon Scale)
 
 These three above charts illustrate the alpha diversity present across the different sample sites. Overall, all the JGI sample sites showed significantly higher levels of diversity for the raw observations as well as the Fisher index; however, when entropy is taken into account with shannon diversity, the gap narrows, and the standard (U'ren) and JGI primer datasets are closer to one another. the JGI still has somewhat higher diversity, though. Additionally, while the JGI species counts are more variable for the results of the Observed and Fisher values, they show less variability in Shannon entropy. The inverse is seen with results from the standard primer set. 
 
 
Observed Values:
 
```{r}

Fisher Values:

```

Shannon Values:

The results for the Wilcoxon signed rank test with continuity correction results were as follows: 

Observed diversity featured a p-value of 3.608e-12. The alternative hypothesis was true, because the location was not not equal to 0. The Shannon diversity featured a p-value of 3.61e-12. The alternative hypothesis was true, because the location was not equal to 0. The Fisher diversity featured a p-value = 3.608e-12. The alternative hypothesis was true, because  the location was not equal to 0

![Rarefaction Curve Results](Figures/CombinedDataFigures/CombinedDataRrarecurve.png)

These results show that in terms of species per sample size, the JGI data overall scales up to a maximum of ~600 ASV/sample and a miminum of 400 ASV/sample after random sampling, with the standard primer samples not reach more than 200. The pre-wetting samples notably scored exceptionally low in species found per sample size from the standard primers; this trend was not observed for the JGI primers.

## Beta Diversity Ordination and PCoA Results


![](Figures/CombinedDataFigures/CombinedPCoAOrdSource.png)
(Fig. 2: Ordination Plot by Sample Source)
This ordination plot compares the similarities of OTUs between the JGI and Standard (U'ren) primer datasets. Overall, both sample sets show a similar trend in OTU clustering, with the OTUs of several sites clustering together in one side of ordination space, with the rest spread out throughout the space. Although both datasets show similar clustering trends, the JGI set features more sites' OTUs clustering together, with 9 clustering sites vs. 23 clusterings for the standard primer set.

!(Figures/CombinedDataFigures/PCoAOrdbySiteandNum.png)
(Fig. 3: Ordination Plot by Sample Site and Number)

The same sample data ordination as before, but this time colored by sample site and featuring shapes by sample number. The sample number is equal to the hours after watering the site. The main standout trend is that before watering, the samples tend to spread out in ordination space. However, beginning in the 3 hours after watering, the samples trend towards clustering on the left side of the ordination space. After 6 hours, all of the samples are clustered on the left side of the ordination space. After 11 hours, the samples begin to spread out again and migrate to the right side once again


## VEGAN Beta Diversity

The average distance to the median for the results of the homogeneity of multivariate dispersions by sample source were 0.6117 for the JGI, and 0.6044 for the U'ren data.

![Beta Diversity by Sample Source](Figures/CombinedDataFigures/BetaDispersionbySampleSource.png)
![Beta Diversity by Source Boxplot](Figures/CombinedDataFigures/BetaDispbySampleSourceBox.png) 

In terms of the beta diversity PCoA analyses, the two primer sets feature similar geometries of relatedness between sample sites within a dataset, with a cluster of similar sites on one end, and a spread of sites not closely similar to either each other or the main cluster on the other. However, the U'ren data is more stochastic, with more clusterings and greater distances from each other.

The average distance to median for the homogeneity of multivariate dispersions by sample site were 0.5309 for HP-JGI, 0.5525 for HP-U'ren, 0.5309 for LP-JGI, 0.4932 for LP-U'ren, 0.6019 for NE-JGI, 0.5958 for NE-U'ren, 0.5866 for NW-JGI, 0.4932 for NW-U'ren, 0.4992 for S-JGI, and 0.6343 for S-U'ren.

![Beta Diversity by Sample Site Boxplot](Figures/CombinedDataFigures/BetaDispBySampleSiteBox.png)

A graphical illustration of the results of the beta diversity PCoA, but this time displayed by sample site. Overall, much of the variability in the U'ren data is being driven by the LP and NW sites, which feature large clusterings and large gaps between their maxima and minima. the gaps in centroid distance between the S-JGI and S-U'ren data are notable, as are the distance gaps between NW-JGI and NW-U'ren. 

The permutation test for homogeneity of multivariate dispersions of combined data was as follows:


## FUNGuild Functional Guild Assignment
Overall, there were 7886 successful assignments out of a total of 35,711 attempted assignments, for a 22.1% assignment rate. 

In terms of Functional guild, the majority of the the fungal species present in the Biosphere 2 forest are generalist soil saprobes, representing 61% of the functional guilds. specialized wood saprobes were 40% of the saprobe OTUs. Pathogens of plants represented 20% of OTUs. Endophytic species were present in 12.3% of OTUs. specialized animal pathogens represented 1.66% of OTUs. ECM fungi represented 2.6% of OTUs. There was some overlap between functional groups, particularly with wood saprobes and plant pathogens, as many tree pathogens continue to decay wood after the death of the tree.

In terms of taxonomy, the two most abundant were the Ascomycota, with 6018 species, and Basidiomycota, with 1030 species. Together, these phyla accounted for 89% of the fungi successfully assigned functional groups.

## Implications of Revealed Diversity

In terms of alpha diversity, the measures on the Shannon scales are, on average, on the lower end of values gained in similar ecosystems in studies on natural habitats for the standard primer dataset, and roughly average for the JGI primer dataset. Shannon values averaged between 3-7 in studies on similar tropical forest ecosystems [@satish2007diversity; @kerekes2013nutrient; @mcguire2012fungal; @peng2020inconsistent; @banakar2012diversity; @chernov2019microbiomes]. the standard primers averaged 1.5-3.5, and the JGI primers average 4.3-5.6. This means that overall, the diversity and eveness of the species present is comparable to natural tropical forest ecosystems on a broad scale. Since the sample size contributing to the JGI dataset is significantly larger, it's likely that it's a better indicator of the diversity present.

In terms of Fisher's scale, the JGI results are unusual in that they tend to be significantly higher than values found in other studies [@satish2007diversity; @kerekes2013nutrient; @mcguire2012fungal; @peng2020inconsistent; @banakar2012diversity; @prakash2015ecology]. Results from  these studies rarely find Fisher values for any site above 100; typical values are within the 10-40 range for these studies. One study with values between 40-100 was an outlier; however, this study was also deliberately determining how soil enrichment affected fungal growth, so the Fisher values could have been abnornally inflated [@kerekes2013nutrient]. the standard primer datasets featured values that were in line with the findings of most of the studies, save the outlier mentioned previously, with values ranging between 10 and 40. It is notable that this is the opposite trend displayed with the Shannon index values, with the JGI values tending to be closer to what was found in other studies. One explanation of the reason for the unusually large Fisher's values are due to the very large size of the JGI dataset; the size of the JGI dataset is much larger than the standard primer dataset, which tends to be more in line with the majority of the studies cited here. This results of the alpha diversity indicate one of two things: Either the size of the JGI dataset is significantly skewing the results, or the majority of the studies cited do not have a large enough sample size to adequately represent the diversity present.

In terms of the PCoA analysis, an interesting trend manifests itself with concern to OTU abundance over time value in watering. Namely, after watering, the sample data tends to cluster up until 6 hours, then reduce in clustering again. The clustering is most likely caused by a dramatic expansion in growth by a small number of species that respond to the increase in moisture with a dramatic increase in metabolic activity, increasing the amount of their OTUs present in the soil sample. Since the species is/are likely common to all of the sample sites, there is a convergence in ordination space at 6 hours; this time likely represents the peak in the growth time of the fungi. This is likely related to the soil samples being taken in the dry season, when many non-pathogenic, soil sabropic fungal species are dormant in the dry soil. Fungi, in general, are highly moisture-dependent, and only fruit and grow in high-moisture environments. The watering brought these species out of dormancy over several hours, peaking at 6 hours, and the return to dry season soil conditions precipitated their decline back to previous diversity levels. The reason for the clustering is likely because the water added to the soil was only enough to draw a few rapidly responding species out of dormancy. With more water and monitoring time, it is possible that the site clustering would disperse again throughout ordination space, as less abundant and slower-growing taxa became more prominent.

In terms of FUNGuild functional guild diversity, the results for saprobes are largely consistent with other findings for soil samples in similar ecosystems; the majority of fungal species present in forest soil tend to be saprobes [@lanforest; @schappe2020co; @schimann2020tree]. However, there are two notable differences between this study and others. First, compared to other studies, the levels of plant pathogens in the soil are elevated. Plant pathogens tend to not be abundant in soil in tropical forests, and are instead most abundant in the higher levels of the canopy [@gora2019microbial]. Even in the soil, average pathogen abundance in OTUs across ecosystems is roughly 4% [@makiola2019land], with tropical lowland forests as low as 2% [@schimann2020tree]. The high abundance of pathogens could be due to several reasons. First, it is possible that the long period of neglect of Biosphere 2 during the 2000s lead to higher stress situations for the plants, making them more susceptible to infection by pathogens. Another factor could be that Bioshpere 2 is a fully enclosed ecosystem, making the transfer of pathogen spores from host to host relatively easy. Another factor might be related to the high density of a relatively small number of species, which contributes to higher pathogen load. As the density of many adult trees of the same species increases, the relative abundance of their associated pathogens increases [@liang2016adult]. Finally, luck of the draw could also be a factor, since the fungal biota of the Biosphere 2 was not deliberately engineered, and drew from whatever was included with the animals, plants, and soil brought in during construction. One possible variable influencing the levels of pathogens present could be that these samples were taken during the simulated dry season; levels of pathogens in rainforests tend to increase during the dry season due to higher metabolic activity of the soil vs. lower metabolic activity of host plants [@looby2018shifts]. 

A second result is that the levels of ECM fungi tend to be low. ~1% of OTUs fit into the ECM category; other forest ecosystems tend to feature at least 10% of OTUs being ECM, even in degraded habitats [@wilhelm2017biogeography; @lanforest; @song2019tropical; @schroeder2019host; @schimann2020tree]. At least one of the contributing factors is likely similar to studies on degraded tropical forest vs. intact forest, namely, degraded forest tends to feature less overall tree diversity and more soil disturbance, leading to fewer hosts and more damage to soil ecosystems [@lanforest; @song2019tropical]. However, as mentioned earlier, even degraded ecosystems tend to feature higher ECM diversity than Biosphere 2. This could be explained by soil composition. Namely, the soil of Biosphere 2 is a mixture of artificially added soil, and natural soil present at the site. Southern Arizona is many hundreds of miles away from the Neotropical rainforest habitat most of the plants added to Biosphere 2 originate from, and the original vegetative landscape surrounding Biosphere 2 is Sonoran lowland desert. Thus, it is unlikely that many species of compatible ECM were available to colonize the roots of the trees after planting [@schroeder2019host].

Another interesting result of the FUNGuild assignment is that there were hits for several marine and aquatic lineages of Ascomycete wood decomposers. A possible explanation for this could be the result of the proximity of the rainforest to the mangrove swamp zone of Biosphere 2. Although protected directly from salt spray from that ecosystem, it is possible that spores from marine molds could be drawn up into the air circulation systems and find their way into the rainforest ecosystem. It's also possible that at least some of the molds present in aquatic ecosystems could be present in terrestrial ones as well, particularly ones with high overall levels of moisture such as a rainforest.


## Implications of Primer Differences

In terms of the alpha diversity results, the data do not demonstrate a conclusive difference that could be explained by primers alone. Generally speaking, as sample size increases, the chance of sampling more species in a given sample increases. Therefore, the larger dataset is likely to reveal more of the diversity present in a sample. It is likely that the JGI numbers are a better representation of the diversity present overall, but due to significant difference in sample size, it is not clear if this is because of factors inherent to the primers.

If the number discrepancy were due to more sensitivty from the JGI primers, it would stand to reason that the majority of the sequences amplified by the standard set would overlap with the JGI set, but not vice-versa. However, since there is no obvious overlap, it implies that either the sensitivies of the two primer sets are different enough to be incomparable, or that the sequences amplified by both sets were sufficiently random to generate two non-overlapping datasets. This means, if anything, using the two different primers gave the analysis more power for discerning the diversity present in the sample by covering species which the other may have missed.

The rarefaction curve results indicate that there are still significant differences in diversity revealed between the two datasets even when the size of the dataset variable is reduced, which might suggest that the JGI primers are more sensitive overall. However, when taken in concert with the results of the FUNGuild functional guild analysis, in which there was no overlap between the OTUs amplified by each primer set, this conclusion becomes harder to support. This is because if the JGI primers were more sensitive, it stands to reason that the dataset would feature most of the OTUs of the standard primer set, alongside the OTUs already present. 

One possible cause of the greater distances between the U'ren data and the JGI data is stochasticity introduced from the reduced sample size of the U'ren dataset relative to that of the JGI. Since the U'ren dataset is smaller, each dataset has a higher chance of sampling different OTUs than the others; as more sampling occurs, there is less overlap in sampled OTUs. This is supported by there being a much higher variation between the minima, maxima, and outliers found in the values for the U'ren data with the standard primers.

Overall, the data are not conducive to being able to argue one primer set being stronger than another. This is due to factors such as the large size discrepancy between the two datasets leading to possible undersampling in the standard primer dataset, as well as the fact that no overlap was found between identified OTUs in the FUNGuild functional analysis. However, these data may suggest that using both primers in conjunction may be beneficial from a perspective of studying diveristy. As each primer revealed species that may have otherwise gone un-noticed, this suggests that using multiple primers, even ones which target the same ITS spacer regions, may end up being beneifical in future studies that aim to sample the widest array of species possible in a study.

## Implications for shaping future Biosphere 2 ecology

In terms of diversity, the overall diversity of the soil fungi is high, and comparable to numbers found in natural ecosystems. However, as the other results indicate, there is an imbalance in the kinds of species that are present that needs to be addressed. Based on the FUNGuild results, the implications of the elevated levels of pathogens and relative lack of ECM fungi implies that the soil ecosystem of Biosphere 2 is highly degraded, and likely does not function in a similar way to a natural soil ecosystem. These results are consistent with other studies on plants and insects in the rainforest that showed that most species come from a small number of abundant species [@wetterer1999ecological; @leigh1999tropical]. Two efforts that could be undertaken in order to balance the soil ecology of the Biosphere 2 rainforest would be introducing more ECM fungi relevant to a neotropical ecosystem, and increasing the diversity of trees present in the ecosystem. Most of the pathogens in the FUNGuild results are described as opportunistic and/or generalistic, meaning that it is likely that a reduction in stress conditions could dramatically decrease their prevalence. Also, weeding out overabundant species and seeding in more diverse, ecosystem-appropriate species will make it harder for pathogens to spread from host-to-host [@schroeder2019host]. However, the enclosed, cramped nature of the Biosphere 2 rainforest will still favor easy transmission of plant pathogens relative to natural ecosystems, and will need to be factored into future forest management.

## Future Directions

In terms of the results from the diversity analyses, the main thing that future studies could do to improve comparison results between the standard and JGI primers is to take large sample sizes for both primer types. This will have the effect of both reducing stochasticity within and between samples, as well as revealing more overlap between primers. Due to the large size of the JGI dataset already present, it may be possible to simply do another round of sampling with the standard primers, with the goal of gaining a significantly larger sample size than before that is more comparable to the JGI dataset.

In terms of the FUNGuild results, a future direction could be taken in studying more in-depth the extent and presence of the pathogens in the plants of the Biosphere 2 rainforest. Of particular interest would be sampling higher up in the understory and canopy, to see how the prevalence of foliar pathogens correlates with other studies of foliar canopy pathogens, as well as determine the diversity of pathogens to understand host specificity. Other studies could be done on which ECM and tree species would be best to introduce from neotropical lowland ecosystems in order to better diversify and strengthen the soil, growing the fungal and plant communites of the rainforest and making them both more resilient and a better facsimilie of a natural ecosystem.

For soil microbial ecology as a whole, the results revealed here do not suggest which primer set may be more effective for obtaining OTUs of soil fungi. However, they do go a long way into revealing the diversity of soil fungi present in Biosphere 2, which will assist ecologists with the University of Arizona understand what kinds of functional groups of fungi are present in this facility. By understanding this, they can use this knowlegde to better know how to proceed with the ongoing maintainence, restoration, and development of this valuable ecological research resource.
