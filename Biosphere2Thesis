# Introduction

## Soil Microbial Ecology: A Primer

Soil Microbial Ecology is, broadly defined, the study of living things fully or partially invisible to the naked eye such as Bacteria, Archaea, and some Eukaryotes, in the context of how they interact with other living organisms present in an edaphic environment. This typically also includes fungi, mites, and nematodes, since although many of them are at least partially macroscopic, most ecologically relevant interactions take place on a microscopic level [@pavao2008soil].  These interactions are an important area of study for ecology as a whole, since the microscopic edaphic ecology is of fundamental importance to two major ecological processes: the recycling of decaying organisms into soil nutrients, and the acquisition of those nutrients by plants [@amber2008soil]. The majority of soil microorganisms present in a given ecosystem are generally involved in one of these two processes, either primarily or secondarily (e.g. as parasites of plants or predators of soil microbes) [@pavao2008soil]. Extending out further, the soil microbial community has profound impacts on every organism present in an ecosystem, as soil-rooted plants form the energetic basis of the majority of the planet's terrestrial ecosystems. Some examples of important interactions include the nitrogen fixation of certain plant groups with symbiotic bacteria, arbuscular endomycorrhizal fungi associated with the roots most plant groups, and ectomycorrhizal fungi associated with the roots of trees.

## Methods of Study

Although the importance of soil has been widely recognized as fundamental to ecosystems for years, the ability to study it in-depth has had to wait on the development of modern microsopic and molecular techniques in order to be able to elucidate much of the diversity and interactions present in the soil [@pavao2008soil]. Starting in the 19th century, compound microscopes enabled scientists to view some microorganisms with the naked eye [@weisenburger2015light]; however, while microscopy is useful for studying things such as morphology, it gives limited information as to the ecological roles, interactions, and diversity present in a given sample of soil. In order to understand these interactions, molecular biological techniques developed with the discovery of DNA and the development of DNA recovery technologies such as PCR [@morange2000history] allowed the collection of environmental DNA from soil. By isolating DNA samples present in a soil sample, it became possible to create detailed profiles of organisms present in a given soil ecosystem. This DNA is isolated from the soil by the use of primers, which are short, single-stranded nucleic acids used by organisms in the initiation of DNA synthesis. These primers recognize specifc regions of DNA that are unique to a specifc group of organisms, allowing only DNA from that group to be isolated from a sample.

## Fungal Soil Primers

Creating primers to isolate fungal species present in soil presents unique challenges compared to other groups. Compared to groups such as Bacteria, who use the ribosomal coding region of DNA for primer recognition, much of the fungal DNA in the ribosomal region is highly conserved, even between distantly related species. Due to this, fungal primers target instead two regions on either side of the fungal ribosomal 5.8S subunit called Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) units. These units of DNA flank the 5.8S subunit both upstream (ITS1) and downstream (ITS2) [@xu2016fungal]. The majority of fungal DNA isolation targets these two regions, as they feature a high degree of variability between fungal groups due to not being translated or otherwise used for coding proteins [@xu2016fungal]. Thus, they make an ideal target for primer development and species identification. Over the last 10 years, several different groups have developed competing primer sets. As standardization and reproducibility across datasets is of high importance for scientific research and inquiry, it is important that studies are done to determine which types of fungal primers are most effective for elucidating the fungal diversity present in a sample. Though examining the results of two different ITS2 primer amplified datasets using in silico bioinformatics techniques, this study aims to provide evidence of which ITS2-targetting primer set may be more effective at reveaing soil fungal diversity present in a sample.

## Soil Microbial Profiles: Study Data Source

The primary source of data for this study came from an Honor's thesis project done by Juliana Young at the University of Arizona, with the assistance of primary faculty collaborator Dr. Jana U'Ren, among others [@young2017microbial], who collected and provided much of the data. The primary goal of the study was to examine nitrous oxide flux cycles in the soils of the enclosed tropical rainforest found in the Biosphere 2 reserve located outside of Tuscon, Arizona. She was testing to see how periodic drought affected the production of nitrous oxide, a byproduct of soil microbial metabolism, at various locations throughout the rainforest. In doing this, she sequenced a large amount of genomic data from both the bacterial and fungal communities present in these sites. however, she was only able to evaluate the data for the bacterial communities, leaving an open question as to the extent of the fungal diversity present in these rainforest samples. Understanding the diversity present in the Biosphere 2 reserve is important for understanding how well the ecosystem can act as a facsimile for naturalistic ecosystems, as well as helping the maintainers of the Biosphere 2 plan ways to engineer the reserve to be a better experimental environment for simulating a tropical forest ecosystem.

## What is Biosphere 2?

Biosphere 2 is what is called a mesocosm; that is, an environment which simulates a variety of natural ecosystems in an enclosed environment [@marino1999biosphere]. In addition to simulating rainforest, it simulates coral reef, desert, and grassland ecosystems as well.
Biosphere 2 represents a good environment for studying in-depth chemical cycling processes because it provides both easier and more controlled access to a variety of ecosystems, making it a popular place for studying in-depth envrionmental cycling processes [@atkinson2001nutrient, @severinghaus1995studies, @nelson1999bioregenerative, @van2005drought]. This is because a wide variety of sensor equipment is present in the facility, making data collection easy [@marino1999biosphere]. However, Biosphere 2 is not without issues. In particular, it displays a limited variety of organisms present in each environment, and the ecosystems present have been likened to ecosystems under high pressure from humans.

## History of Biosphere 2

Biosphere 2 was conceived by businessman Ed Bass and systems ecologist John P. Allen in 1984 as an attempt to create a prototype of the "spaceship earth", a fully enclosed, self-sustaining ecosystem capable of supporting and sustaining human life, as well as the lives of other organisms. These reserves could act as insurance against calamity, or aid in long-distance space travel and exploration [@allen1990historical]. It was named Biosphere 2 to play off the idea that the earth itself was "Biosphere 1". As the human aspect was the main initial focus, the initial attention of the research was directed towards sustaning humans in the environment, with two experiments conducted in the 90s involving people living in the Biosphere 2 seperate from the outside world for 2 years and 6 months, respectively. Overall, the experiments were not considered successful, and outside intervention was required in both cases to enable human survival due to mismanagement both before and during the missions [@allen1999overview, @severinghaus1994oxygen, @weyer2000energy]. Besides the human aspect, there were failures ecologically: many of the species added to the Biosphere 2 did not survive well, and the ecosystems became dominated by only a few hardy pioneer species [@wetterer1999ecological, @leigh1999tropical]. During the late 90s and early 2000s, the Biosphere 2 fell into disrepair. In 2007, it was acquired by the University of Arizona, who began a long redesign and rehabilitation process of the the Biosphere as a dedicated biological research facility. In order to rehabilitate and use the facility for serious long-term ecological study, it is important to understand the current extent of the biological diversity present, both on a micro and macro scale, so that future work can be done in order to introduce new species to make up ecological imbalances, as well as endeavoring to remove or mitigate the prescence of intefering species. 

## Overview of Study

This study aims to take the un-analyzed dataset of fungal genomic sequences gathered by Young et al. and analyze them in the context of fungal diversity, using several genomic data statistical processing and display software suites, using primarily the R scripting language in the RStudio integrated open-source coding and development software program. Using the phyloseq and VEGAN genomic RStudio-based statistical analysis software packages, along with the FUNGuild fungal functional guild assignment software in the Python scripting language, this study aims to process the raw genomic data gathered by Young et. al. These analyses, statistics, and graphics will elucidate two primary questions: firstly, what is the overall levels of fungal soil microbial diversity in the rainforest soil of Biosphere 2, and secondly, which set of primers is better at revealing the diversity of soil organisms present in these samples?

# Methods

## Original Data Collection

The original data collection was done under an Honors project done by Juliana Young at the University of Arizona with assistance from several other collaborators, including Dr. Jana U'ren, her faculty advisor [@young2017microbial]. The original study was examining nitrous oxide pulse dyanmics under drought conditions in the simulated rainforest environment of Biosphere 2. Collection was done at 5 different sites located throughout the rainforest, at several soil depths: Northwest (NE) at 1 (0-100cm), 2 (100-200 cm), and 3 (200-300 cm) depths, South (S) at 1, 2, and 3 depths, and Northwest (NW) at depths 1 and 2. in order to estimate drought effects, samples were taken before adding water, after 3 hours, 6 hours, 9 hours, and 11 hours. Additionally, a high-pulse (HP) nitrogen site was identified near the NE site, and a low-pulse (LP) nitrogen site was sampled near the S site. Both were harvested at the 1st depth only. Sequencing on the samples were done with 16S rRNA primers (for bacteria) and ITS2 Primers (for fungi). The two primer sets for the ITS analysis were ones created by the Joint Genome Institute of the U.S. Department of Energy, with the second set being developed by Ihrmark et al 2012 [@ihrmark2012new].

## Preprocessing of FASTA files

In order to preprocess the FASTA files for efficient display of data further down the pipeline, the two primer datasets were downloaded and combined into one source file, removing any data sample locations appearing in only one primer dataset to ensure comparability. The files were then renamed appropriately using names from provided metadata CSVs to ensure ease of software compatibility and visualisation. Files sequencened using the standard primer dataset had the prefix LM. added for Laura Meredith, the collaborator who sequenced them, while the ones sequenced using the JGI primers had the -JGI suffix added to each file. Other than that, files were named by the time in hours they were sampled after watering (Pre, 3, 6, 9 and 11), the sample location (NE, S, NW, LP, and HP), and the sample soil depth (1, 2 or 3)

## DADA2

DADA2 is an open-source software suite developed by Callahan et al. for modelling and correcting errors in Illumina-sequenced genomic datasets [@callahan2016dada2]. Before processing with DADA2 software functions, the file location was set. After this, the filter_path function was used in order to filter out bad reads.
                              
For that function, the following parameters were chosen: The first 20 bases of each read were removed (to remove the primer), remove all reads with ambiguous nucleotides (Ns), allow no more than 4 errors, and truncate sequences at a size (240 bp) which quality analysis suggested was the longest size before significant drops in read quality occured. The filtered results from this were fed into the learnErrors function, which estimated the number of errors present in the samples. This was followed by the derepFastq function, which removed duplicate sequences found in the ITS data. Next, the data was piped through the dada function. This program  is the core random sample interference algorithm of DADA2, which randomly sampled the data from each distinct data point to reduce the overall size of the data pool, while allowing for accurate assesment of the traits of the data.

In order to move forward in the pipeline, the data was compiled into a sequence table. After this, chimeric sequences could be removed from the data using the removeBimeraDenovo function. FInally, taxonomoy was assigned using the taxa function, using the latest release of the UNITE fungal database as a reference.

                       
The filtered, dereplicated, inferred, dechimeraed, and taxonomy-assigned data could then be handed off to the phyloseq function.


## Phyloseq

Phyloseq is an R package designed for reproducibl,e interactive analysis and visualization of microbiome data [@mcmurdie2013phyloseq]. It was one of the main visualization software packages used, along with the VEGAN package. In order to visualize the data, a special data format called a phyloseq object was created using the phyloseq package by utilizing the sequence table and taxa table from DADA2, along with a manually created .csv file to create qualitative data useful for data visualisation. Following this, the phyloseq package was used to create several plots of the overall species richness across the different sample sites and depths using the plot_richness phyloseq function using the "observed", "Fisher", and "Shannon" alpha diversity assessment indicies.                       


## VEGAN

VEGAN is a software package designed to add useful statisical functions for ecologists to the basic R package for use in RStudio [@dixon2003vegan]. Functions in this toolset were used to generate statistical and graphical outputs. 

Before use in the various functions, the OTUs were extracted from the phyloseq object and prepared for applications using the otu_table phyloseq function to extract the OTU tables from the general phyloseq object, then the VEGAN rareification toolset to randomly sample and rarefy the resulting data. The random sampling before rarefaction was important to do because there was a large size discrepancy bewteen the sampling sizes in the standard and JGI primer datasets, with the JGI set being much larger. Without some form of random sampling and size standardization between the two datasets, there could be skewed results that make comparison harder. Summary stat tables of the alpha diversity of the OTUs were then created for the observed, Fisher, and Shannon alpha diversity measures.

The next test done on the data involved using the rarecurve function to create a rarefaction curve; this curve allowed for a more accurate comparison between the standard and JGI datasets by controlling for the significantly larger sample size present in JGI sample size, while presenting it in a graphical display format.
 
The final set of analyses done using the VEGAN stats package involved estiamting the beta diversity of the samples using the beta dispersion function. This was created via processing the rarefied data using a Bray-Curtiss dissimilarity index.
 
The permutest function was used in order to ensure the homogeneity of the multivariate dispersions. Sample source was used to group the data so that the differences between the JGI and standard datasets could be accurately visualized by the plot function.

## FUNGuild

FUNGuild is an open-source Python script developed by Nguyen et al. at the University of Minnesota, St. Paul that is designed to parse fungal OTU datasets and assign functional groups to the OTUs based on a taxonomy [@nguyen2016funguild]. In order to use the script, the taxonomy CSV file was formatted into a compatible form by use of the paste function, and was then merged with the original sequence table CSV using the merge function. 

# Results

## Species Richness Results 

![Alpha Diversity: Observed](Figures/CombinedDataFigures/CombinedAlphaRRare.png)

![Alpha Diversity: Shannon](Figures/CombinedDataFigures/CombinedAlphaShannon.png)
 
 These three above charts illustrate the alpha diversity present across the different sample sites. Overall, all the JGI sample sites showed significantly higher levels of diversity for the raw observations as well as the Fisher index; however, when entropy is taken into account with shannon diversity, the gap narrows, and the standard (Uren) and JGI primer datasets are closer to one another. the JGI still has somewhat higher diversity, though. Additionally, while the JGI species counts are more variable for the results of the Observed and Fisher values, they show less variability in Shannon entropy. The inverse is seen with results from the standard primer set.

These results show that in terms of species per sample size, the JGI data overall scales up to a maximum of ~600 species/sample and a miminum of 400 Species/sample after random sampling, with the standard primer samples not reach more than 200. The pre-wetting samples notably scored exceptionally low in species found per sample size from the standard primers; this trend was not observed for the JGI primers.

## Beta Diversity Ordination and PCoA Results


![Ordination Plot by Sample Source](Figures/CombinedDataFigures/CombinedPCoAOrdSource.png)

This ordination plot compares the similarities of OTUs between the JGI and Standard (Uren) primer datasets. Overall, both sample sets show a similar trend in OTU clustering, with the OTUs of several sites clustering together in one side of ordination space, with the rest spread out throughout the space. Although both datasets show similar clustering trends, the JGI set features more sites' OTUs clustering together, with 9 outlier sites vs. 23 outliers for the standard primer set.

![Ordination Plot by Sample Site](Figures/CombinedDataFigures/CombinedOrdinationBySite.png)

The same sample data ordination as before, but this time colored by sample site. There are no visually standout trends as to which sample sites are more likely to produce outliers from the cluster than other. The only sample site to not produce any outliers was the S-JGI sample site.

In terms of the beta diversity PCoA analyses, the two primer sets feature similar geometries of relatedness between sample sites within a dataset, with a cluster of similar sites on one end, and a spread of sites not closely similar to either each other or the main cluster on the other. However, the Uren data is more stochastic, with more outliers and greater distances from each other.

# Discussion

## Implications of Revealed Diversity

In terms of alpha diversity, the measures on the Shannon scales are, on average, on the lower end of values gained in similar ecosystems in studies on natural habitats for the standard primer dataset, and roughly average for the JGI primer dataset. Shannon values averaged between 3-7 in studies on similar tropical forest ecosystems [@satish2007diversity, @kerekes2013nutrient, @mcguire2012fungal, @peng2020inconsistent, @banakar2012diversity, @chernov2019microbiomes]. the standard primers averaged 1.5-3.5, and the JGI primers average 4.3-5.6. This means that overall, the diversity and eveness of the species present is comparable to natural tropical forest ecosystems on a broad scale. Since the sample size contributing to the JGI dataset is significantly larger, it's likely that it's a better indicator of the diversity present.

In terms of Fisher's scale, the JGI results are unusual in that they tend to be significantly higher than values found in other studies [@satish2007diversity, @kerekes2013nutrient, @mcguire2012fungal, @peng2020inconsistent, @banakar2012diversity, @prakash2015ecology]. Results from  these studies rarely find Fisher values for any site above 100; typical values are within the 10-40 range for these studies. One study with values between 40-100 was an outlier; however, this study was also deliberately determining how soil enrichment affected fungal growth, so the Fisher values could have been abnornally inflated [@kerekes2013nutrient]. the standard primer datasets featured values that were in line with the findings of most of the studies, save the outlier mentioned previously, with values ranging between 10 and 40. It is notable that this is the opposite trend displayed with the Shannon index values, with the JGI values tending to be closer to what was found in other studies. One explanation of the reason for the unusually large Fisher's values are due to the very large size of the JGI dataset; the size of the JGI dataset is much larger than the standard primer dataset, which tends to be more in line with the majority of the studies cited here. This results of the alpha diversity indicate one of two things: Either the size of the JGI dataset is significantly skewing the results, or the majority of the studies cited do not have a large enough sample size to adequately represent the diversity present.

In terms of FUNGuild functional guild diversity, the results for saprobes are largely consistent with other findings for soil samples in similar ecosystems; the majority of fungal species present in forest soil tend to be saprobes [@lanforest, @schappe2020co, @schimann2020tree]. However, there are two notable differences between this study and others. First, compared to other studies, the levels of plant pathogens in the soil are elevated. Plant pathogens tend to not be abundant in soil in tropical forests, and are instead most abundant in the higher levels of the canopy [@gora2019microbial]. Even in the soil, average pathogen abundance in OTUs across ecosystems is roughly 4% [@makiola2019land], with tropical lowland forests as low as 2% [@schimann2020tree]. The high abundance of pathogens could be due to several reasons. First, it is possible that the long period of neglect of Biosphere 2 during the 2000s lead to higher stress situations for the plants, making them more susceptible to infection by pathogens. Another factor could be that Bioshpere 2 is a fully enclosed ecosystem, making the transfer of pathogen spores from host to host relatively easy. Another factor might be related to the high density of a relatively small number of species, which contributes to higher pathogen load. As the density of many adult trees of the same species increases, the relative abundance of their associated pathogens increases [@liang2016adult]. Finally, luck of the draw could also be a factor, since the fungal biota of the Biosphere 2 was not deliberately engineered, and drew from whatever was included with the animals, plants, and soil brought in during construction. One possible variable influencing the levels of pathogens present could be that these samples were taken during the simulated dry season; levels of pathogens in rainforests tend to increase during the dry season due to higher metabolic activity of the soil vs. lower metabolic activity of host plants [@looby2018shifts]. 

A second result is that the levels of ECM fungi tend to be low. ~1% of OTUs fit into the ECM category; other forest ecosystems tend to feature at least 10% of OTUs being ECM, even in degraded habitats [@wilhelm2017biogeography, @lanforest, @song2019tropical, @schroeder2019hos, @schimann2020tree]. At least one of the contributing factors is likely similar to studies on degraded tropical forest vs. intact forest, namely, degraded forest tends to feature less overall tree diversity and more soil disturbance, leading to fewer hosts and more damage to soil ecosystems [@lanforest, @song2019tropical]. However, as mentioned earlier, even degraded ecosystems tend to feature higher ECM diversity than Biosphere 2. This could be explained by soil composition. Namely, the soil of Biosphere 2 is a mixture of artificially added soil, and natural soil present at the site. Southern Arizona is many hundreds of miles away from the Neotropical rainforest habitat most of the plants added to Biosphere 2 originate from, and the original vegetative landscape surrounding Biosphere 2 is Sonoran lowland desert. Thus, it is unlikely that many species of compatible ECM were available to colonize the roots of the trees after planting [@schroeder2019host].

Another interesting result of the FUNGuild assignment is that there were hits for several marine and aquatic lineages of Ascomycete wood decomposers. A possible explanation for this could be the result of the proximity of the rainforest to the mangrove swamp zone of Biosphere 2. Although protected directly from salt spray from that ecosystem, it is possible that spores from marine molds could be drawn up into the air circulation systems and find their way into the rainforest ecosystem. It's also possible that at least some of the molds present in aquatic ecosystems could be present in terrestrial ones as well, particularly ones with high overall levels of moisture such as a rainforest.


## Implications of Primer Differences

In terms of the alpha diversity results, the data do not demonstrate a conclusive difference that could be explained by primers alone. Generally speaking, as sample size increases, the chance of sampling more species in a given sample increases. Therefore, the larger dataset is likely to reveal more of the diversity present in a sample. Thus, it is likely that the JGI numbers are a better representation of the diversity present overall, but due to significant difference in sample size, it is not clear if this is because of factors inherent to the primers.

As mentioned earlier, 498 of the sequences were found with the standard primers, and 8115 were found with the JGI primers. While this difference is large, it is also notable that there is also minimal overlap in amplified sequences between the two datasets. If the number discrepancy were due to more sensitivty from the JGI primers, it would stand to reason that the majority of the sequences amplified by the standard set would overlap with the JGI set, but not vice-versa. However, since there is no overlap, it implies that either the sensitivies of the two primer sets are different enough to be incomparable, or that the sequences amplified by both sets were sufficiently random to generate two non-overlapping datasets. This means, if anything, using the two different primers gave the analysis more power for discerning the diversity present in the sample by covering species which the other may have missed.

The rarefaction curve results indicate that there are still significant differences in diversity revealed between the two datasets even when the size of the dataset variable is reduced, which might suggest that the JGI primers are more sensitive overall. However, when taken in concert with the results of the FUNGuild functional guild analysis, in which there was no overlap between the OTUs amplified by each primer set, this conclusion becomes harder to support. This is because if the JGI primers were more sensitive, it stands to reason that the dataset would feature most of the OTUs of the standard primer set, alongside the OTUs already present. 

One possible cause of the greater distances between the Uren data and the JGI data is stochasticity introduced from the reduced sample size of the Uren dataset relative to that of the JGI. Since the Uren dataset is smaller, each dataset has a higher chance of sampling different OTUs than the others; as more sampling occurs, there is less overlap in sampled OTUs. This is supported by there being a much higher variation between the minima, maxima, and outliers found in the values for the Uren data with the standard primers.

Overall, the data is not conducive to being able to argue one primer set being stronger than another. This is due to factors such as the large size discrepancy between the two datasets leading to possible undersampling in the standard primer dataset, as well as the fact that no overlap was found between identified OTUs in the FUNGuild functional analysis. However, these data may suggest that using both primers in conjunction may be beneficial from a perspective of studying diveristy. As each primer revealed species that may have otherwise gone un-noticed, this suggests that using multiple primers, even ones which target the same ITS spacer regions, may end up being beneifical in future studies that aim to sample the widest array of species possible in a study.

## Implications for shaping future Biosphere 2 ecology

In terms of diversity, the overall diversity of the soil fungi is high, and comparable to numbers found in natural ecosystems. However, as the other results indicate, there is an imbalance in the kinds of species that are present that needs to be addressed. Based on the FUNGuild results, the implications of the elevated levels of pathogens and relative lack of ECM fungi implies that the soil ecosystem of Biosphere 2 is highly degraded, and likely does not function in a similar way to a natural soil ecosystem. These results are consistent with other studies on plants and insects in the rainforest that showed that most species come from a small number of abundant species [@wetterer1999ecological, @leigh1999tropical]. Two efforts that could be undertaken in order to balance the soil ecology of the Biosphere 2 rainforest would be introducing more ECM fungi relevant to a neotropical ecosystem, and increasing the diversity of trees present in the ecosystem. Most of the pathogens in the FUNGuild results are described as opportunistic and/or generalistic, meaning that it is likely that a reduction in stress conditions could dramatically decrease their prevalence. Also, weeding out overabundant species and seeding in more diverse, ecosystem-appropriate species will make it harder for pathogens to spread from host-to-host [@schroeder2019host]. However, the enclosed, cramped nature of the Biosphere 2 rainforest will still favor easy transmission of plant pathogens relative to natural ecosystems, and will need to be factored into future forest management.

## Future Directions

In terms of the results from the diversity analyses, the main thing that future studies could do to improve comparison results between the standard and JGI primers is to take large sample sizes for both primer types. This will have the effect of both reducing stochasticity within and between samples, as well as revealing more overlap between primers. Due to the large size of the JGI dataset already present, it may be possible to simply do another round of sampling with the standard primers, with the goal of gaining a significantly larger sample size than before that is more comparable to the JGI dataset.

In terms of the FUNGuild results, a future direction could be taken in studying more in-depth the extent and presence of the pathogens in the plants of the Biosphere 2 rainforest. Of particular interest would be sampling higher up in the understory and canopy, to see how the prevalence of foliar pathogens correlates with other studies of foliar canopy pathogens, as well as determine the diversity of pathogens to understand host specificity. Other studies could be done on which ECM and tree species would be best to introduce from neotropical lowland ecosystems in order to better diversify and strengthen the soil, growing the fungal and plant communites of the rainforest and making them both more resilient and a better facsimilie of a natural ecosystem.
